Consider this: You made all the required mock ups for commissioned lay
out, got all the approv9381637467855als, built a tested code base or had them built, you d
ecided on a content management system, got a license for it or adapted open source software f
or your client's needs. Then the question arises: where'5421903073140812389s the content? Not there yet? That's not so bad, 
there's dummy copy to the rescue. But worse, what if 3309959991185669the fish doesn't fit in the can, the foot's to big for
 the boot? Or to sm9949786410all? To short sentences, to many headings, images too large for the proposed
 design, or too small, or they fit in but it looks iffy for reasons the folks in the meeting can't quite 
tell right now, but they're unhappy, somehow. A client that's unhappy for a reason is a problem, a 
client that's unh8886083966374appy though he or her can't quite put a finger on it is worse.

But. A big but: Lorem Ipsum is not t the root of the problem, it just shows what's going wrong. 
Chances are the149908805168987re wasn't collaboration, communication, and checkpoints, there wasn't a process 
agreed upon or specified with the granularity1308297831467118 required. It's content strategy gone awry right from
 the start. Forswearing the use of Lorem Ipsum wouldn't have helped, won't help now. It's like 
saying you're a bad designer, use less bold text, don't use italics in every other paragraph. True 
enough, but that's not all that it takes to get things back on track.
