Write code to assign the number of characters in the string rv to a variable num_chars.
rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;
    Only this and nothing more."""


Write one for loop to print out each element of the list several_things. Then, write another for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the list several_things. To complete this problem you should have written two different for loops, each of which iterates over the list several_things, but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.

several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]


Write code that uses iteration to print out the length of each element of the list stored in str_list.

str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]



Write code to count the number of characters in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_chars. Do NOT use the len function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)

original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."



addition_str is a string with a list of numbers separated by the + sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to sum_val (an integer). (You should use the .split("+") function to split by "+" and int() to cast to an integer).
addition_str = "2+5+10+20"


week_temps_f is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the , sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to avg_temp. Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in week_temps_f) (You should use the .split(",") function to split by "," and float() to cast to a float).

week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"


Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable nums.
nums=[]


Write code to create a list of word lengths for the words in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_words_list. (You should use the len function).
original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."

Create an empty string and assign it to the variable lett. Then using range, write code such that when your code is run, lett has 7 b’s ("bbbbbbb").
lett = ''


rainfall_mi is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every month separated by a comma. Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. Store the result in the variable num_rainy_months. In other words, count the number of items with values > 3.0.

rainfall_mi="1.65, 1.46, 2.05, 3.03, 3.35, 3.46, 2.83, 3.23, 3.5, 2.52, 2.8, 1.85"


The variable sentence stores a string. Write code to determine how many words in sentence start and end with the same letter, including one-letter words. Store the result in the variable same_letter_count.
sentence = "students flock to the arb for a variety of outdoor activities such as jogging and picnicking"


Write code to count the number of strings in list items that have the character w in it. Assign that number to the variable acc_num.
items = ["whirring", "wow!", "calendar", "wry", "glass", "", "llama","tumultuous","owing"]


Write code that counts the number of words in sentence that contain either an “a” or an “e”. Store the result in the variable num_a_or_e.
Note 1: be sure to not double-count words that contain both an a and an e.
HINT 1: Use the in operator.
HINT 2: You can either use or or elif.
sentence = "python is a high level general purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems."



Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence s and assign the result to the variable num_vowels. For this problem, vowels are only a, e, i, o, and u. Hint: use the in operator with vowels.

s = "singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be fun"
